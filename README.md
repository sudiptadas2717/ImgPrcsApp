## Tasks:-
1. Design and build an attractive user interface (Ul) for the web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Ul should feature a navigation bar, a form for uploading images, and a section to display both the original and processed images.
2. Construct the front-end of the web application using a contemporary JavaScript framework like React or Vuejs. Ensure the application is responsive and offers a smooth user experience.
3. Build a back-end for the web application using a framework such as Flask or Streamlit.
The back-end should manage image processing tasks using libraries like OpenCV or scikit-image.
4. Apply object detection to the uploaded images, for instance, recognizing types of vehicles and counting them.
5. Package the web application using Docker for easy deployment. Create a Docker file and a docker-compose.yl file to specify the application's environment and services.
6. Compose a concise README file describing how to set up, run, and test the web application locally. Include any required installation instructions and dependencies.
7. Important! Create/record/screen-capture a short demonstration video highlighting the Ul and capabilities of the web application, including the object detection feature. Upload the demo video to the project's GitHub repository.
8. Submit the URL of the GitHub repository containing the code and demo video using this form.
# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
